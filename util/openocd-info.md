How To Install and Use OpenOCD
==============================
<p>This document details how to compile the latest Open OCD from source and use it with Olimex's ARM-USB-OCD-H jtag programmer to program and debug Atmel's sam3u chip.  Most popular package managers will likely maintain Open OCD, but I had trouble using some of their versions (eg: the package on mac's homebrew) - hence we will compile from source.</p>
<p>Open source tools are used when possible</p>
<p>Open OCD and the other tools used will likely have dependencies which your system may or may not have - I advise you to read their respective READMEs</p>
